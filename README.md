<h1>CODE REFRACTOR</h1>

The first assignment given at UConn Coding Bootcamp was to refract the code to make it more accessable in a workplace environment. I have added the necessary changes to make the HTML file more acessible to those who read the code.

The Horiseon Online Service website is now ready to be optimized for various search engines as the HTML code has properly working links, pictures, and sementics. The website can now be more easily accessed and understood by more people.
